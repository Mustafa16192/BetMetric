# BetMetric Future Directions & Explorations

This document captures strategic discussions regarding the Go-To-Market (GTM) strategy, operational improvements for the MVP, and evolving domain terminology.

## 1. Terminology Update
*   **Old Term:** "Zombie" (Too informal/aggressive).
*   **New Term:** **"Dormant"**.
*   **Feature Name:** "Dormancy Monitor".
*   **Action:** "Decommission" (instead of "Kill").
*   **Rationale:** "Dormant" is professional, neutral, and aligns with standard accounting terms for inactive accounts/assets.

## 2. MVP Enhancements: "High-Resolution Accountability"
To maximize utility without requiring heavy manual data entry:

### A. The "Runway" Feature (Burn Rate Focus)
Instead of tracking every small transaction:
*   **Mechanism:** Users input a "Monthly Burn Rate" (e.g., Headcount + Cloud + Ads).
*   **Value:** System decrements budget automatically.
*   **Result:** A "Death Clock" showing months remaining before $0.

### B. The "Monday Morning Standup" Generator
*   **Mechanism:** A simple "Weekly Update" text field on every Bet.
*   **Value:** Auto-generates a one-page executive summary (Green/Red/Dormant bets).
*   **Result:** Replaces manual slide creation for weekly meetings.

### C. Scenario Planning ("What-If" Sandbox)
*   **Mechanism:** A "Draft" mode for the Strategy Tree.
*   **Value:** Drag-and-drop budget re-allocation to see impact on runway.
*   **Result:** A decision-making tool for resource allocation, not just a backward-looking tracker.

## 3. Operational Workflow
How the system fits into a company's rhythm:

1.  **Quarterly (Setup):** Build the **Strategy Tree** (The Map). Allocate budget to nodes.
2.  **Monthly/Weekly (Input):** Tag "Burn Rate" or large expenses to nodes.
3.  **Real-Time (Logic):** Recursive P&L rolls up spend; ROI is calculated.
4.  **Daily (Monitoring):** Executives check **Health Colors** (Red/Green/Yellow).
5.  **Proactive (Intervention):** **Dormancy Monitor** flags inactive bets. User chooses to "Revive" or "Decommission".
6.  **Ad-Hoc (Interrogation):** Use **Escrow Agent (AI)** for instant financial answers.

## 4. Go-To-Market (GTM) Strategy

### Core Narrative
*   **Hook:** "Your bank account tells you *that* you are bleeding. BetMetric tells you *where*."
*   **Positioning:** A **Financial Control Tower** for Growth-Stage Executives (Series B-D).
*   **The Enemy:** Vanity Metrics and Dormant Projects.

### Target Audience (ICP)
*   **"Wartime" COO/CFO:** Needs to extend runway and cut burn without killing growth.
*   **VC Operating Partners:** Needs to audit portfolio efficiency.

### Marketing Channels
*   **LinkedIn:** "Anatomy of a Dormant Project" teardowns. High-contrast, data-heavy visuals.
*   **Outbound:** The "Efficiency Audit" - find waste in their ledger.
*   **Website:** "Stop Flying Blind."

### Pricing Strategy (Value-Based)
*   **Tier 1 (Control):** Flat fee ($1-2k/mo). Dashboard + Ledger.
*   **Tier 2 (Intelligence):** Premium ($5k+/mo). Includes AI + Dormancy Monitor.

### The "Trojan Horse"
1.  **Start Manual:** Sell as a Strategic Planning Tool (The Tree).
2.  **Up-Sell:** Automate data entry via bank integrations later.
